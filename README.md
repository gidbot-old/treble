<h1>
Treble Blog
</h1>

<h4> Format Instructions and Tips: </h4>
1) Its recommended to use a featured image for each blog post. Without images, this blog will be extremely stale. Picture galleries and videos are also encouraged. <br> <br>
2) Rectangular Featured Images Look Better. <br> <br>
3) Before Publishing, upload the post as <b> PRIVATE </b>. This way, we can test the layout to see if it is up to standards. In order to relase the post, just take it off <i>private</i> and onto <i>public</i>.
