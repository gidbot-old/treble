<h1>
Treble Blog
</h1>

<h4> Format Instructions and Tips: </h4>
1) It is recommended to use a featured image for each blog post. Without images, this blog will be extremely stale. Picture galleries and videos are also encouraged. <br> <br>
2) Rectangular Featured Images Look Better. <br> <br>
3) Do not change logos or any layout without first talking to the manager of the site. You should only be adding posts and media, not changing any design aspects. 
4) Before Publishing, upload the post as <b> PRIVATE </b>. This way, we can test the layout to see if it is up to standards. In order to relase the post, just take it off <i>private</i> and onto <i>public</i>.
