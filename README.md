<h4> Before Publishing a Post: </h4> 
  - Assign a category to the post. 
  - Upload the post as <b> PRIVATE </b>. This way, we can test the layout to see if it is up to standards. 
  - Check to make sure layout is as expected
  - Switch post to <b>PUBLIC </b> and it'll go live.


<h4> General Instructions and Tips: </h4>
1) Do not change logos or any layout without first talking to the manager of the site. You should only be adding posts and media, not changing any design aspects. <br>
2) It is recommended to use a featured image for each blog post. Without images, this blog will be extremely stale. Picture galleries and videos are also encouraged. <br>
3) Rectangular Featured Images Look Better. <br>
